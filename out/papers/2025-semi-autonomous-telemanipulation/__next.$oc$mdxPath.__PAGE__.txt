By estimating the operator’s intent using Bayesian filtering on the intersection of the end-effector direction and the target plane, the system switches to automatic control for 32% of the operation time. This reduces operator fatigue and achieves 74.6% intent recognition accuracy, proving efficiency improvements regardless of operator skill level."}]],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/a99412a3d4e4064b.js","async":true}]],["$","$L2",null,{"children":["$","$3",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@4"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
