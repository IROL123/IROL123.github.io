By switching locomotion modes via hand gestures, operators can precisely control their viewpoint, reducing motion sickness and fatigue. Experiments confirm that this multi-mode approach enables smooth robot control and better spatial understanding in complex environments."}]],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/_next/static/chunks/a99412a3d4e4064b.js","async":true}]],["$","$L2",null,{"children":["$","$3",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@4"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
