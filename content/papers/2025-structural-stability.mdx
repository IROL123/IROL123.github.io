This paper presents a Structural Stability Assessment (SSA) based method for efficient order picking in box-stacked storage. A CNN model evaluates the stability of the remaining structure if a target box is removed directly. Achieving 97% accuracy with real data, this method allows for direct picking without dismantling upper layers when safe, enhancing both efficiency and safety in logistics automation.
