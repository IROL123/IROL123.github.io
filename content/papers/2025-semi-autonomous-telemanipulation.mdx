This study proposes a semi-autonomous telemanipulation control method for order-picking in box-stacking storage environments. By estimating the operator's intent using Bayesian filtering on the intersection of the end-effector direction and the target plane, the system switches to automatic control for 32% of the operation time. This reduces operator fatigue and achieves 74.6% intent recognition accuracy, proving efficiency improvements regardless of operator skill level.
