This project focuses on developing methods for robots to autonomously manipulate objects in unstructured environments. Our approach combines perception, planning, and control to enable robust manipulation in real-world scenarios.

## Research Goals

1. **Visual Perception**: Develop robust visual perception systems for object recognition and pose estimation.
2. **Motion Planning**: Create efficient motion planning algorithms for complex manipulation tasks.
3. **Learning from Demonstration**: Enable robots to learn new skills from human demonstrations.
